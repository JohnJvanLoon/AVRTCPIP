1) Creating an Account and Installing Github:
  - If you are able to read this you have already created an account
  - Follow this Link : https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/ to initially set up Git on your PC
  
2) Forks and Pulls 
  - Github has 2 types of collaborative methods: We are using the Fork and Pull method for this project.
    1. Fork and Pull
      Fork - By clickin the small "+" to the right of the repository name you can create your own fork. This
            will allow you to add new files or add edits to existing ones. Once you have created your new file or
            added your edits the changes will only be saved in your personal fork. 
      Pull - Now you must submit a pull request for your changes to be added to the main repository. On the right
             beside the file window you will see a pull request button. Once on the pull request screen at the top
             right there is a green button named "New pull request" . Hitting this will take you to a pull creation
             screen. At the top of the window click "Compare accross forks" . Then select your fork and the master 
             and submit. John will then be able to see the changes and either except them or not.
             
             Here is a more inclusive summary of pull requests: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ 
             
  3) You can edit the files online within the Github wensite or by connecting with SSH using git. 
        
      
 4) For the course project you should request permission prior to working on a particular issue. 
    All work to be accomplished will be posted to the issue section. Each issue will carry associated marking.
