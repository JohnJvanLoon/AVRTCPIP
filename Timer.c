/**
* timer_set_delay
* \brief Sets a 1-255 mS delay.
* 
*	Sets up a 1-255 mS delay using Timers/Counter 0 output compare interrupts to 
* count time in 1 mS intervals.
*	Only 5 delays can run at one time as the variable "delays" has been initialized
* as a 5 element array.  To start a delay you must both specify a delay number and
* a delay value (delay_number, delay).  Please make sure you use the timer_check_delay
* first to make sure a given delay number is not already in use.  This function will
* also not give any sort of notification when the delay is over, again the timer_check_delay
* must be used to check when the delay is over.
*	Timer/Counter 0 will trigger an interrupt every 1 mS to decrement the specified 
* delay.
* 
* \parameter delay_number The delay identification number (0-4).
* \parameter delay The amount of mS to delay (1-255).
* 
* This function doesn't return anything.

/**
* timer_check_delay
* \brief Checks if a delay has finished.
* 
*	Checks if a delay has finished by taking a delay id and seeing if it 
* is equal to 0.  If the delay has reached 0 the delay has completed and 
* the function will return a value of 1, if the delay has not reached 0 the
* function will return 0 to indicate the delay is not over yet.
* 
* \parameter delay_number The delay identification number (0-4).
* 
* returns 1 if delay has finished, 0 if the delay isn't over yet.

/**
* init_timer0
* \brief Initializes Timer/Counter 0 and output compare for 1 mS interrupt.
* 
*	Initializes Timer/Counter 0 in CTC mode with a prescaler of /64, and sets the 
* output compare register to a value of 125 (decimal).
* 	Interrupts are enabled for output compare matches when the timer_set_delay function is
* called and the interrupt is disabled when there are no delays in use.  This function does not
* enable global interrupts.  Please enable global interrupts somewhere else in this program before use.
*	Setting the prescaler to /64 gives a clock of 125 KHz to the counter, that is a 
* period of 0.000008 mS.  This means that 125 clock cycles take exactly 1 mS.  The 
* value of the output compare register is therefor set to 125 in order to trigger an
* interrupt exactly every 1 mS.
*	The timer is started in CTC mode in order to clear the timer each time it reaches
* a value of 125 (which is 1 mS).
* Does not return any values or accept any arguments/parameters.
